<h2 class="clickable-heading">Bio</h2>
<div style="display:none">
<p> I make my living teaching the card game bridge -
<a href="https://www.andrewrobson.co.uk/at_the_club/meet_the_team/">running workshops and directing games</a>.
My academic background is in mathematics (including two masters degrees) but I enjoy learning anything I can find a MOOC about.
I occasionally work as a statistician, normally on a voluntary basis. Here's my profile on
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deeprich/">LinkedIn</a>
</p>
<p>
I frequently use open source software, typically with a functional programming style. I'm most familiar with R,
sometimes use Python and am curious about Julia.
